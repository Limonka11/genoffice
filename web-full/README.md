# GenOffice Docs as an embeddable web editor (Vound fork)

`web-full/` hosts the Docs app's complete renderer (`apps/docs/src/renderer/main.tsx`, unchanged) in a
plain web page. `shim.ts` stands in for the Electron bridge (`window.desktop`), `boot.ts` installs it and
loads the app, `host.css` and two transforms in `vite.config.ts` adjust the app for use as a viewer:

- header/footer strips take the document's base font (upstream rule only covered the body);
- header/footer strips are not dimmed;
- break-only spacer paragraphs are one line, not two (`.doc-br-line` inline);
- the host decides editability; a document's own `w:documentProtection` lock is not enforced.

Engine change in `packages/docx-engine/src/text-patch.ts` (`patchFieldParagraphText`, called from
`generate.ts` and `patch.ts`): a text edit inside a legacy form field or a content control patches
the `w:t` of the original paragraph and keeps the field machinery. Test:
`packages/docx-engine/tests/field-paragraph-text-patch.test.ts`.

## Build

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts        # repo root, Node 22+
npm run build:web-host         # -> web-full/dist (static, relative asset paths, ~22 MB with fonts)
```

## Embed

Serve `web-full/dist` under any path and put it in an iframe. The contract is `embed-protocol.ts`:

| direction | message |
|---|---|
| host → editor | `{ type: 'vound:open', name, bytes: ArrayBuffer }` open a document (transfer the buffer) |
| host → editor | `{ type: 'vound:command', command: 'save' \| 'save-as' \| 'undo' \| 'redo' }` |
| editor → host | `{ type: 'vound:ready' }` after the editor subscribed to open requests |
| editor → host | `{ type: 'vound:saved', name, bytes: ArrayBuffer }` on every save (⌘S, File › Save, the save command) |
| editor → host | `{ type: 'vound:error', message }` |

`embed-example.html` is a working host page. In production, check `event.origin` on both sides and
serve the editor from its own origin or path. The editor never persists anything itself when embedded;
the host receives the bytes and stores them.

## Develop

```sh
npx vite --config web-full/vite.config.ts    # http://localhost:5201 (standalone mode with a sample panel)
```

Standalone mode serves `web-full/samples/*.docx` (gitignored), answers `fontMetrics` from
`@genoffice/font-metrics` and writes saves to `GENOFFICE_SAVE_DIR`. Embedded mode has no font-metrics
service; the app falls back to its bundled metric-compatible faces.
