// Review mode tells the host what the reviewer does in marked blocks: vound:blockEdited when an edit of
// theirs changes a marked block's text, and vound:caretBlock when the caret enters a marked block or leaves
// one. Tab is the reviewer's "next field": it neither indents nor inserts a tab, and when the caret is in a
// marked block it reports leaving it with Tab. Mod-Enter and Mod-Shift-Backspace accept and reject the field at
// the caret (fieldActionKeys.ts). The host's own writes (fieldWrite.ts, HOST_WRITE_META) and
// the app's bookkeeping transactions are not the reviewer's edits.
//
// A field passthrough (a legacy form field) is typed into inside its node view: those keys and the DOM caret
// never reach ProseMirror (the node view's stopEvent), and the text reaches the document only when the editor
// commits the field. So the caret counts as in the field's block while the DOM selection is inside a field
// being edited, and Tab there is caught before the node view, commits the field and reports leaving.
